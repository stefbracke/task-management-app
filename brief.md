# Project: Task Management App

## Objective:

Create a simple task management application where users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The goal is to practice the fundamentals of Vue for state management, component structure, and event handling, while using Tailwind for styling.

## Requirements:

1. **Task List View:**

   - Display a list of tasks.
   - Each task should show its title, description, and a checkbox for marking it complete.

2. **Add New Task:**

   - A form to input a task title and description.
   - Add button to submit the new task and display it in the task list.

3. **Edit Task:**

   - Allow users to edit a taskâ€™s title and description by clicking an edit button.

4. **Delete Task:**

   - A button to remove a task from the list.

5. **Mark Task Complete:**
   - Checkbox to mark the task as complete.
   - Completed tasks should have a visual indicator (e.g., a strikethrough or different background colour).

## Features to Implement:

- Use Vue for state management, binding, and reactivity.
- Use Tailwind for responsive, modern UI components (e.g., buttons, form, and list styling).
- Ensure tasks persist in the browser's local storage so the task list is maintained after a page refresh.

## Bonus:

- Add filters to view All, Completed, and Incomplete tasks.
- Include a due date field for each task, and highlight tasks that are overdue.
